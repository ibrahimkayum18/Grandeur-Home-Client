A real state property dealing website where you can buy property as a user and sell the property as an agent. Project features-

- 3 different roles are set in the project, user, agent, and admin panel 
-.User can offer price and buy property.
- The agent accepts or declines the user-offered amount, and adds the property 
- The agent verifies the property, manages users and creates agents
